In 2001, [Bob Palais](http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/) wrote the article [_π
is wrong!_](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF03026846), remarking on the fact that
when π occurs in nature, it occurs as 2π most of the time. He suggests that
2π = 6.283185... should be given a name (τ is now a fan favorite) and that it
should be used instead of π. Some found his arguments convincing, including
[Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/). In 2010, Hartl published [The
Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), and the τ movement was born.

### Historical uses

- (All quotes are translated from the German translation by P. Luckey, 1950.)

  While Archimedes was able to bound the ratio of a circle circumference and
  diameter between 223/71 (≈ 3.1408) and 22/7 (≈ 3.1428), [Jamshid al-Kashi
  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshid_al-Kashi) wanted to determine it to a
  much higher precision. In his 1424 _Treatise on the circumference of the
  circle_, it was his goal that

  > in a circle whose diameter is 600,000 times the diameter of the earth, the
  > difference between it [the calculated circumference] and the true
  > circumference is less than a single hair, which is one sixth of the width
  > of an average barley grain, such that it [the difference] in a [circle]
  > which is smaller than that doesn't matter.

  This translates to approximately 14 decimal digits.

  His calculations are performed in sexagesimal (base 60) digits. In section 8,
  _Transformation of the value of the circumference into the Indian digits
  under the condition that half of the diameter be one_, he gives the result in
  decimal digits:

  > We put the digits from left to right onto a half-verse, to get a verse:
  >
  > > wa baḥǧā ḥahǧi ṣaz a za ṭah ḥawahu
  > >
  > > muḥīṭun li-quṭrin huwa ’ṯnāni minhu
  >
  > 6 2 8 3 1 8 5 3 0 7 1 7 9 5 8 6 5
  >
  > is the circumference for a diameter which is two thereof.
  >
  > And in Persian:
  >
  > > šaš wa du hašt wa sih yak hašt wa panǧ wa sih ṣifrā
  > >
  > > bahaft wa yakrā [haft] wa nuh panǧ wa hašt wa šaš panǧ ast
  >
  > Six and two eight and three one eight and five and three, a zero with seven
  > and one [seven] and nine five and eight and six five is [it].

- The section _Adoption of the symbol π_ of the excellent Wikipedia article
  [Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Adoption_of_the_symbol_%CF%80) says:

  > In the earliest usages, the Greek letter π was used to denote the
  > semiperimeter (_semiperipheria_ in Latin) of a circle and was combined in
  > ratios with δ (for diameter or semidiameter) or ρ (for radius) to form
  > circle constants. (Before then, mathematicians sometimes used letters such
  > as c or p instead.) The first recorded use is Oughtred's "δ.π", to express
  > the ratio of periphery and diameter in the 1647 and later editions of
  > _Clavis Mathematicae_. Barrow likewise used "$`\frac{\pi}{\delta}`$" to
  > represent the constant 3.14..., **while Gregory instead used
  > "$`\frac{\pi}{\rho}`$" to represent 6.28...**
  >
  > The earliest known use of the Greek letter π alone to represent the ratio
  > of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician
  > William Jones in his 1706 work _Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos_; or, _a New
  > Introduction to the Mathematics_. The Greek letter first appears there in
  > the phrase "1/2 Periphery (π)" in the discussion of a circle with radius
  > one. However, he writes that his equations for π are from the "ready pen of
  > the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin", leading to speculation that Machin
  > may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not
  > immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation
  > still being used as late as 1767.
  >
  > Euler started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 Essay
  > _Explaining the Properties of Air_, **though he used π = 6.28..., the ratio
  > of periphery to radius, in this and some later writing.** Euler first used
  > π = 3.14... in his 1736 work Mechanica, and continued in his widely-read
  > 1748 work _Introductio in analysin infinitorum_ (he wrote: "for the sake of
  > brevity we will write this number as π; thus π is equal to half the
  > circumference of a circle of radius 1"). Because Euler corresponded heavily
  > with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread
  > rapidly, and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western
  > world, **though the definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as
  > late as 1761.**

### Some equations

- Trigonometry

  ```math
  \begin{split}
  \sin(\alpha) &= \sin(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \cos(\alpha) &= \cos(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \tan(\alpha) &= \tan(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha
  \end{split}
  ```

  With τ being a full revolution, the following identities are very easy to
  grasp (for integers _n_). Remember the sine is the projection of the angle
  onto the _y_-axis, the cosine is the projection onto the _x_-axis.

  ```math
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    \sin(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,          &\qquad \cos(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,\\
    \sin((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,\\
    \sin((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1,\\
    \sin((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1, &\qquad \cos((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0
  \end{alignat*}
  ```

  - sin(27.4 π) – Where is my calculator?
  - sin(13.7 τ) – 13 full revolutions: forget about those. Plus .7, that's
    almost 3/4 of a revolution, so probably something close to −1. (Actual
    value: −0.95105651629...)

- Area of the _n_-dimensional unit sphere

  ```math
  |U_n|
  = \frac{2\textcolor{teal}{\pi}^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}
  = \begin{cases}
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  \textcolor{orange}{\tau} & \text{if } n = 2\\
  |U_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / (n - 2) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

- _n_-dimensional Gegenbauer integral over the unit ball <i>S<sub>n</sub></i>:

  ```math
  |G_n^{\lambda}|
    = \int_{S^n} \left(1 - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\right)^\lambda
    = \begin{cases}
      1&\text{for $n=0$}\\
      B\left(\lambda + 1, \frac{1}{2}\right)&\text{for $n=1$}\\
      |G_{n-2}^{\lambda}|\times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / (2\lambda + n) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  ```

  Note that the [Beta function
  _B_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function), with one argument ½,
  includes a factor $`\sqrt{\pi}`$.

  Special cases:

  - Volume of the _n_-dimensional unit ball (_λ_=0):

    ```math
    |S_n|
    = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } n = 0\\
    2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
    |S_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / n & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    ```

  - The area of a disk (_λ_ = 0, _n_ = 2)

    ```math
    |S_n(r)|
    = \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}{2} r^2
    = \textcolor{teal}{\pi} r^2
    ```

  - _n_ = 1, _λ_ = −1/2

    ```math
    \int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \textcolor{teal}{\pi}
    ```

  - _n_ = 1, _λ_ = 1/2

    ```math
    \int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2} = \frac{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}}{2}
    ```

- _n_-dimensional generalized Cauchy volume

  2 _λ_ > _n_.

  As appearing in its one-dimensional version in the [Cauchy
  distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution) and
  [Student's _t_
  distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution).

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
    |Y_n^{\lambda}|
      &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\right)^{-\lambda}\\
      &= \begin{cases}
        1&\text{for $n=0$}\\
        B\left(\lambda - \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right)&\text{for $n=1$}\\
        |Y_{n-2}^{\lambda}|\times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / (2\lambda - n) & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  ```

  Note again that the [Beta function
  _B_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function), with one argument
  ½, includes a factor `$\sqrt{\pi}$`. Specifically, for _n_ = 1
  and _λ_ = 1,

  ```math
  |Y_1^1| = B(\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}) = \textcolor{teal}{\pi}.
  ```

<!--
- Consider the integral

  ```math
  \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^\alpha} = \frac{\textcolor{teal}{\pi} / \alpha}{\sin(\textcolor{teal}{\pi}/\alpha)}
  ```

  for all _α_ > 1, specifically

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \textcolor{teal}{\pi}.
  ```

  This is relevant in the [Cauchy
  distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution).

- Consider the normalization of [Student's
  _t_-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution),

  ```math
  V(\gamma) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2/\gamma}^{\gamma+1}}
  = \frac{\sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}\gamma} \Gamma(\gamma/2)}{\Gamma((\gamma+1) / 2)}
  ```

  for all _γ_>0. specifically,

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
  V(1) &= \textcolor{teal}{\pi},\\
  V(2) &= 2\sqrt{2}.
  \end{align*}
  ```

  Interestingly, values for larger _γ_ can be determined via the recurrence

  ```math
  V(\gamma) = \frac{\sqrt{\gamma(\gamma-2)}}{\gamma-1} \times V(\gamma - 2)
  ```

  which is perhaps a bit more revealing than the closed-form expression with
  the Gamma function evaluations.

- _n_-dimensional generalized Laguerre volume

  ```math
  \begin{align*}
    V_n
    &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \left(\sqrt{x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2}\right)^\alpha \exp\left(-\sqrt{x_1^2+\dots+x_n^2}\right)\\
    &= \begin{cases}
      2\Gamma(1+\alpha)&\text{if $n=1$}\\
      \textcolor{orange}{\tau}\Gamma(2 + \alpha)&\text{if $n=2$}\\
      V_{n-2} \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} (n+\alpha-1) (n+\alpha-2) / (n-2) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  ```

- more such examples at [ndim](https://github.com/sigma-py/ndim)

- Compare

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}},\qquad
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2 / 2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}
  ```

  One could argue that the latter is more "canonical" since it has variance and
  standard deviation of 1, not ½ and $`\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}`$. Compare with the
  [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right) \,dx= 1

- [Particular values of the Gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular_values_of_the_gamma_function)

  - Positive half-integers:

    $`\Gamma(\tfrac{1}{2}) = \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}}`$, so all
    half-integer values of Γ contain that factor (recall Γ(_z_+1) = _z_ Γ(_z_)):

    ```math
    \Gamma(n + \tfrac{1}{2})
    = \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}} \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left(i + \frac{1}{2}\right)
    ```

    for _n_ ∈ ℕ. Equivalently:

    ```math
    \Gamma(n + \tfrac{1}{2})
    = \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}} \frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^n}
    ```

    or (for odd _n_ > 0)

  ```math
  \operatorname{erf}(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}}} \int_0^z \exp(-t^2)\, dt.
  ```

  In statistics, for non-negative values of _x_, the error function has the
  following interpretation: for a random variable _Y_ that is normally
  distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation $`1/\sqrt{2}`$, erf(_x_) is
  the probability that _Y_ falls in the range [−<i>x</i>, _x_].

  The same property with standard deviation 1 is fulfilled by

  ```math
  \operatorname{erf}_1(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}} \int_0^z \exp(-t^2 / 2)\, dt.
