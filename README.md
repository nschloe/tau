In 2001, [Bob Palais](http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/) wrote the article
[_π is wrong!_](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF03026846), remarking on the fact
that when π occurs in nature, it occurs as 2π most of the time. He suggests that
2π=6.283185... should be given a name (τ is now a fan favorite) and that it
should be used instead of π. Some found his arguments convincing, including
[Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/). In 2010, Hartl published
[The Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), and the τ movement was
born.

This page lists notable articles, videos, discussion etc. about τ.

### Historical uses

The section _Adoption of the symbol π_ of the excellent article
[Pi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pi) says:

> In the earliest usages, the Greek letter π was an abbreviation of the Greek
> word for periphery (περιφέρεια), and was combined in ratios with δ (for
> diameter) or ρ (for radius) to form circle constants. (Before then,
> mathematicians sometimes used letters such as c or p instead.) The first
> recorded use is Oughtred's "δ.π", to express the ratio of periphery and
> diameter in the 1647 and later editions of Clavis Mathematicae. Barrow
> likewise used "`$\frac{\pi}{\delta}$`" to represent the constant 3.14...,
> **while Gregory instead used "`$\frac{\pi}{\rho}$`" to represent 6.28...**
>
> The earliest known use of the Greek letter π alone to represent the ratio of a
> circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William
> Jones in his 1706 work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction
> to the Mathematics. The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase "1/2
> Periphery (π)" in the discussion of a circle with radius one. However, he
> writes that his equations for π are from the "ready pen of the truly ingenious
> Mr. John Machin", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the
> Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by
> other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late
> as 1767.
>
> Euler started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 Essay
> Explaining the Properties of Air, **though he used π = 6.28..., the ratio of
> periphery to radius, in this and some later writing.** Euler first used π =
> 3.14... in his 1736 work Mechanica, and continued in his widely-read 1748 work
> Introductio in analysin infinitorum (he wrote: "for the sake of brevity we
> will write this number as π; thus π is equal to half the circumference of a
> circle of radius 1"). Because Euler corresponded heavily with other
> mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly, and the
> practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world, **though the
> definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as late as 1761.**

### Some equations

[![xhub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rendered%20with-xhub-f2eecb?style=flat-square)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xhub/anidddebgkllnnnnjfkmjcaallemhjee)

The following equations are best consumed on Chrome with
[xhub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xhub/anidddebgkllnnnnjfkmjcaallemhjee)
installed.

- Trigonometrics

  ```math
  \begin{split}
  \sin(\alpha) &= \sin(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \cos(\alpha) &= \cos(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \tan(\alpha) &= \tan(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha
  \end{split}
  ```

  With `$\tau$` being a full revolution, the following identities are very easy
  to grasp (for integers `$n$`). Remember the sine is the projection of the
  angle onto the _y_-axis, the cosine is the projection onto the _x_-axis.

  ```math
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    \sin(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,          &\qquad \cos(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,\\
    \sin((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,\\
    \sin((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1,\\
    \sin((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1, &\qquad \cos((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0
  \end{alignat*}
  ```

  Trigonometric values off the grid can easily be estimated:

  - `$\sin(27.4 \textcolor{teal}{\pi})$` – Where is my calculator?
  - `$\sin(13.7 \textcolor{orange}{\tau})$` – 13 full revolutions: forget about
    those. Plus .7, that's almost 3/4 of a revolution, so probably something
    close to -1. (Actual value: -0.95105651629...)

- Area of the _n_-dimensional unit sphere

  ```math
  |U_n|
  = \frac{2\textcolor{teal}{\pi}^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}
  = \begin{cases}
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  \textcolor{orange}{\tau} & \text{if } n = 2\\
  |U_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / (n - 2) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

- Volume of the _n_-dimensional unit ball

  ```math
  |S_n|
  = \frac{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2 + 1)}
  = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } n = 0\\
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  |S_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / n & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

  The area of a disk:

  ```math
  A = \textcolor{teal}{\pi} r^2 = \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}{2} r^2
  ```

- more such examples at [ndim](https://github.com/nschloe/ndim)

- Compare

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}},\qquad
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2 / 2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}
  ```

  One could argue that the latter is more "canonical" since it has
  variance/standard deviation of 1, not `$\frac{1}{2}$` /
  `$\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$`. Compare with the
  [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right) \,dx= 1
  ```

  ```

- [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)

  ```math
  \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \exp(-i\textcolor{orange}{\tau} x\xi)\,dx,\quad
  f(x)         = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) \exp(i\textcolor{orange}{\tau} x\xi)\,d\xi

  ```

  = \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}} \frac{(n-2)!!}{2^{n/2}}
  ```

  ```math
  \Gamma(1 / 2 + n)
  = \frac{(2n)!}{4^n n!} \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}}
  = \frac{(2n)!}{4^n n!} \sqrt{\frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}{2}}

  \zeta(2) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}^2}{6} = \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}^2}{24}
  ```

  ```math
  \zeta(2n) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^{2n}} = (-1)^{n+1} \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}^{2n} B_{2n}}{2 (2n)!}
  ```

### Going further: `$2\pi i$`?

[Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) (no pun intended)
remarks
[here](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2007/08/is-pi-defined-in-best-way.html?showComment=1186584000000#c971095637512882599):

> It may be that `$2 \pi i$` is an even more fundamental constant than `$2 \pi$`
> or `$\pi$`. It is, after all, the generator of `$\log(1)$`. The fact that so many
> formulae involving `$\pi^n$` depend on the parity of `$n$` is another clue in this
