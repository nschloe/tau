In 2001, [Bob Palais](http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/) wrote the article [_π is
wrong!_](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF03026846), remarking on the fact that whenever π
occurs in nature, it occurs as 2π most of the time. He suggests that 2π=6.283185...
should be given a name (τ is now a fan favorite) and that it should be used instead of
π. Some found his arguments convincing, including [Michael
Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/). In 2010, Hartl published [The Tau
Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), and the τ movement was born.

This page lists notable articles, videos, discussion etc. about τ.

### Historical uses

The section _Adoption of the symbol π_ of the excellent article
[Pi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pi) says:

> In the earliest usages, the Greek letter π was an abbreviation of the Greek word for
> periphery (περιφέρεια), and was combined in ratios with δ (for diameter) or ρ (for
> radius) to form circle constants. (Before then, mathematicians sometimes used letters
> such as c or p instead.) The first recorded use is Oughtred's "δ.π", to express the
> ratio of periphery and diameter in the 1647 and later editions of Clavis Mathematicae.
> Barrow likewise used "$`\frac{\pi}{\delta}`$" to represent the constant 3.14...,
> **while Gregory instead used "$`\frac{\pi}{\rho}`$" to represent 6.28...**
>
> The earliest known use of the Greek letter π alone to represent the ratio of a
> circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William Jones in his
> 1706 work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics.
> The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase "1/2 Periphery (π)" in the
> discussion of a circle with radius one. However, he writes that his equations for π
> are from the "ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. John Machin", leading to
> speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones'
> notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction
> notation still being used as late as 1767.
>
> Euler started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 Essay Explaining
> the Properties of Air, **though he used π = 6.28..., the ratio of periphery to radius,
> in this and some later writing.** Euler first used π = 3.14... in his 1736 work
> Mechanica, and continued in his widely-read 1748 work Introductio in analysin
> infinitorum (he wrote: "for the sake of brevity we will write this number as π; thus π
> is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius 1"). Because Euler
> corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter
> spread rapidly, and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western
> world, **though the definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as late as 1761.**

### Some equations

[![xhub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rendered%20with-xhub-f2eecb?style=flat-square)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xhub/anidddebgkllnnnnjfkmjcaallemhjee)

The following equations are best consumed on Chrome with
[xhub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xhub/anidddebgkllnnnnjfkmjcaallemhjee)
installed.

- Trigonometrics

  ```math
  \begin{split}
  \sin(\alpha) &= \sin(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \cos(\alpha) &= \cos(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \tan(\alpha) &= \tan(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha
  \end{split}
  ```

  With $`\tau`$ being a full revolution, the following identities are very easy to grasp
  (for integers $`n`$). Remember the sine is the projection of the angle onto the
  _y_-axis, the cosine is the projection onto the _x_-axis.

  ```math
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    \sin(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,          &\qquad \cos(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,\\
    \sin((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,\\
    \sin((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1,\\
    \sin((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1, &\qquad \cos((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0
  \end{alignat*}
  ```

  Trigonometric values off the grid can easily be estimated:

  - $`\sin(13.7 \pi)`$ – Where is my calculator?
  - $`\sin(13.7 \tau)`$ – 13 full revolutions: forget about those. Plus .7, that's
    almost 3/4 of a revolution, so probably something close to -1.

- Area of the _n_-dimensional unit sphere

  ```math
  |U_n|
  = \frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}
  = \begin{cases}
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  \textcolor{orange}{\tau} & \text{if } n = 2\\
  |U_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / (n - 2) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

- Volume of the _n_-dimensional unit ball

  ```math
  |S_n|
  = \frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2 + 1)}
  = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } n = 0\\
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  |S_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / n & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

  The area of a disk:

  ```math
  A = \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \textcolor{orange}{\tau} r^2
  ```

- more such examples at [ndim](https://github.com/nschloe/ndim)

- Compare

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2)\,dx = \sqrt{\pi},\qquad
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2 / 2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}
  ```

  One could argue that the latter is more "canonical" since it has variance/standard
  deviation of 1, not $`\frac{1}{2}`$ / $`\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}`$.
  Compare with the [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right) \,dx= 1
  ```

  \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \exp(-i\textcolor{orange}{\tau} x\xi)\,dx,\quad
  f(x)         = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) \exp(i\textcolor{orange}{\tau} x\xi)\,d\xi

  = \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}} \frac{(n-2)!!}{2^{n/2}}
  ```

  ```math
  \Gamma(1 / 2 + n)
  = \frac{(2n)!}{4^n n!} \sqrt{\pi}
  = \frac{(2n)!}{4^n n!} \sqrt{\frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}{2}}
