In 2001, [Bob Palais](http://www.math.utah.edu/~palais/) wrote the article
[_π is wrong!_](https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF03026846), remarking on the fact
that when π occurs in nature, it occurs as 2π most of the time. He suggests that
2π=6.283185... should be given a name (τ is now a fan favorite) and that it
should be used instead of π. Some found his arguments convincing, including
[Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/). In 2010, Hartl published
[The Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), and the τ movement was
born.

This page lists notable articles, videos, discussion etc. about τ.

### Historical uses

- [Al-Kāshī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamsh%C4%ABd_al-K%C4%81sh%C4%AB), _Treatise on the Circumference of the Circle_, 1424. See [Peter
  Harremoës, _Al-Kāshī’s constant_,
  2018](http://www.harremoes.dk/Peter/Undervis/Turnpage/Turnpage1.pdf)

- The section _Adoption of the symbol π_ of the excellent article
  [Pi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pi) says:

  > In the earliest usages, the Greek letter π was an abbreviation of the Greek
  > word for periphery (περιφέρεια), and was combined in ratios with δ (for
  > diameter) or ρ (for radius) to form circle constants. (Before then,
  > mathematicians sometimes used letters such as c or p instead.) The first
  > recorded use is Oughtred's "δ.π", to express the ratio of periphery and
  > diameter in the 1647 and later editions of Clavis Mathematicae. Barrow
  > likewise used "`$\frac{\pi}{\delta}$`" to represent the constant 3.14...,
  > **while Gregory instead used "`$\frac{\pi}{\rho}$`" to represent 6.28...**
  >
  > The earliest known use of the Greek letter π alone to represent the ratio of a
  > circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician William
  > Jones in his 1706 work Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction
  > to the Mathematics. The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase "1/2
  > Periphery (π)" in the discussion of a circle with radius one. However, he
  > writes that his equations for π are from the "ready pen of the truly ingenious
  > Mr. John Machin", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the
  > Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by
  > other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late
  > as 1767.
  >
  > Euler started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 Essay
  > Explaining the Properties of Air, **though he used π = 6.28..., the ratio of
  > periphery to radius, in this and some later writing.** Euler first used π =
  > 3.14... in his 1736 work Mechanica, and continued in his widely-read 1748 work
  > Introductio in analysin infinitorum (he wrote: "for the sake of brevity we
  > will write this number as π; thus π is equal to half the circumference of a
  > circle of radius 1"). Because Euler corresponded heavily with other
  > mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly, and the
  > practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world, **though the
  > definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as late as 1761.**

### Some equations

[![xhub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rendered%20with-xhub-f2eecb?style=flat-square)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xhub/anidddebgkllnnnnjfkmjcaallemhjee)

The following equations are best consumed on Chrome with
[xhub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xhub/anidddebgkllnnnnjfkmjcaallemhjee)
installed.

- Trigonometrics

  ```math
  \begin{split}
  \sin(\alpha) &= \sin(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \cos(\alpha) &= \cos(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha\\
  \tan(\alpha) &= \tan(\alpha + \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) \quad\forall \alpha
  \end{split}
  ```

  With `$\tau$` being a full revolution, the following identities are very easy
  to grasp (for integers `$n$`). Remember the sine is the projection of the
  angle onto the _y_-axis, the cosine is the projection onto the _x_-axis.

  ```math
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    \sin(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,          &\qquad \cos(n \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,\\
    \sin((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 1,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,\\
    \sin((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0,  &\qquad \cos((n + 1/2) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1,\\
    \sin((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= -1, &\qquad \cos((n + 3/4) \textcolor{orange}{\tau}) &= 0
  \end{alignat*}
  ```

  Trigonometric values off the grid can easily be estimated:

  - `$\sin(27.4 \textcolor{teal}{\pi})$` – Where is my calculator?
  - `$\sin(13.7 \textcolor{orange}{\tau})$` – 13 full revolutions: forget about
    those. Plus .7, that's almost 3/4 of a revolution, so probably something
    close to -1. (Actual value: -0.95105651629...)

- Area of the _n_-dimensional unit sphere

  ```math
  |U_n|
  = \frac{2\textcolor{teal}{\pi}^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}
  = \begin{cases}
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  \textcolor{orange}{\tau} & \text{if } n = 2\\
  |U_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / (n - 2) & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

- Volume of the _n_-dimensional unit ball

  ```math
  |S_n|
  = \frac{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2 + 1)}
  = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } n = 0\\
  2 & \text{if } n = 1\\
  |S_{n-2}| \times \textcolor{orange}{\tau} / n & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```

  The area of a disk:

  ```math
  A = \textcolor{teal}{\pi} r^2 = \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}{2} r^2
  ```

- _n_-dimensional generalized Laguerre volume

  ```math
  \begin{align}
    V_n
    &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \left(\sqrt{x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2}\right)^\alpha \exp\left(-\sqrt{x_1^2+\dots+x_n^2}\right)\\
    &= \begin{cases}
      2\Gamma(1+\alpha)&\text{if $n=1$}\\
      \textcolor{orange}{\tau}\Gamma(2 + \alpha)&\text{if $n=2$}\\
      V_{n-2} \times \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}(n+\alpha-1) (n+\alpha-2)}{n-2}&\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  ```

- more such examples at [ndim](https://github.com/sigma-py/ndim)

- Compare

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}},\qquad
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp(-x^2 / 2)\,dx = \sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}
  ```

  One could argue that the latter is more "canonical" since it has
  variance and standard deviation of 1, not `$\frac{1}{2}$` and
  `$\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$`. Compare with the
  [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

  ```math

- [Error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function)

  ```math
  \newcommand{\erf}{\operatorname{erf}}
  ```

  ```math
  \erf(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}}} \int_0^z \exp(-t^2)\, dt.
  ```

  In statistics, for non-negative values of `$x$`, the error function has the
  following interpretation: for a random variable `$Y$` that is normally
  distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation `$1/\sqrt{2}$`, `$\erf(x)$` is
  the probability that `$Y$` falls in the range `$[−x, x]$`.

  The same property with standard deviation 1 is fulfilled by

  ```math
  \widetilde{\erf}(z) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}} \int_0^z \exp(-t^2 / 2)\, dt.
  ```

- Consider the [sinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function) function

  ```math
  \newcommand{\sinc}{\operatorname{sinc}}
  \sinc(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\quad\text{if } x=0,\\
    \sin(x) / x &\quad\text{otherwise,}
  \end{cases}
  ```

  and its integral

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(ax)}{x}\,dx = \textcolor{teal}{\pi} = \frac{\textcolor{orange}{\tau}}{2}
  ```

  for any `$a\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$`. The normalized sinc function is
  defined to have zeros for all `$\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$`, and it's integral
  is 1,

  ```math
  \sinc_{\pi}(x) =
  \frac{\sin(\textcolor{teal}{\pi} x)}{\textcolor{teal}{\pi} x}.
  ```

- Consider the integral

  ```math
  \int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^\alpha} = \frac{\textcolor{teal}{\pi} / \alpha}{\sin(\textcolor{teal}{\pi}/\alpha)}
  ```

  for all $\alpha > 1$, specifically

  ```math
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \textcolor{teal}{\pi}.
  ```

  This is relevant in the [Cauchy
  distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution).

- Consider the normalization of [Student's
  `$t$`-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution),

  ```math
  V(\gamma) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2/\gamma}^{\gamma+1}}
  = \frac{\sqrt{\textcolor{teal}{\pi}\gamma} \Gamma(\gamma/2)}{\Gamma((\gamma+1) / 2)}
  ```

  for all $\gamma>0$. specifically,

  ```math
  V(1) = \textcolor{teal}{\pi},\\
  V(2) = 2\sqrt{2}.
  ```

  Interestingly, values for other `$\gamma\in\mathbb{N}$` can be determined via
  the recurrence

  ```math
  \frac{V(\gamma)}{V(\gamma-2)} = \frac{\sqrt{\gamma(\gamma-2)}}{\gamma-1}
  ```

  which is perhaps a bit more revealing than the closed-form expression with
  the Gamma function evaluations.
